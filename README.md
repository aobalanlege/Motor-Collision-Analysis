Analysis of New York Motor Vehicle Collisions
The following Data Science methodology was adopted in this analysis to answer WHY, WHAT, and HOW in the following parts:

●	Business Understanding: WHY Motor Vehicle collision?   
●	Data understanding: WHAT data? 
●	HOW to analyze the data: Python data science tools (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
Business Understanding:
Why is motor vehicle crash the leading cause of injury-related deaths for New York State residents? Our group has been tasked to analyze data related to vehicle accidents in New York City with the goal to uncover potential patterns in the occurrences of accidents. The questions we are looking to investigate are:  
1.    Which vehicle makes the smallest and the largest accident counts? 
2.    Are some months more accident-prone than others? 
3.    Which vehicle type is more likely to be involved in an accident? This analysis has the potential to provide valuable insight for people and organizations who are working to reduce the risk of accidents in New York City. 
 
Data Understanding:

To get insights into our questions above, we use the NY Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset file given which contains 3.7M rows and 25 columns. This data was collected between 2012 to today 2022. The Motor Vehicle Collisions table contains details about each vehicle involved in the crash. Each row represents a motor vehicle involved in a crash. We extract and filter the dataset to only contain the attributes relevant to our analysis.
